# <Sle's Portfolio>

## Description
- Motivation: To eventually use this as a portfolio to provide in a professional setting. 
- Built this project to learn and improve as a student pursuing full stack development.
- During this project, it involved lots of trouble shooting from simple syntax errors to trying to get css working fine. Especially to fix media re-sizing issues.
- I learned that trying to create a website is extremely difficult. It requires a great amount of creativity to build something "personal." In addition, to make pages to function, it takes a lot of troubleshooting. As I did this homework, I learned that this was a great review and practice.

### Features
The features of the portfolio will have the following:

1. Home Page
  The home page features a clean front page with a simple bacgrkound for the portfolio site. It also has a working navigation bar on top and towards the bottom right there are javicons linked to social media sites.
2. About Me Page
  The About Me page features three cards: background, my passion, moving forward. In each of those cards will provide a picture suited towards it and a brief explanation or summary.
3. Portfolio Page
  The portfolio page features three cards: project 1, project 2, project 3. In each of the cards there is a folder.png which will direct you to a link/page; however, due to the lack of projects I currently have, it is left to run into the current page. This will be updated as the info inside the card once I do have projects to provide.
4. Contact Page
  The contact page features a simple contact form. An user can type in the input text for their first name, last name, their email (provided an example in the text), subject. There is also a submit button which will not work until the form is properly linked to receive.


## Roadmap
Will being add more projects to the project page. In addition will continue to improve the styling and possibly completely revamping the whole portfolio as I better my skills and learn new things.
